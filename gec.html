                                            It was with Civil Engineering Department that GEC Jagdalpur started its journey in the year 1983. With a modest strength of 20 students during its inception, the department has, over the due course of time, expanded its capacity to accommodate 72 students annually. The department added a milestone in its glorious journey towards academic excellence, in 2010, with the commencement of Mastersâ€™ degree program with an intake capacity of 13 students, along with provision for 5 students to be sponsored by the industry, with intent to cater to the expertise demand from the industry.

                                            The department has also been a pioneer in providing consultancy and testing services to the region with an eye on requisite expertise for the infrastructural development of the region and state. Consultancy on soil properties, in-situ as well as controlled testing, by expert technical staff, forms the backbone of major infrastructural projects. Similarly, the department has emerged as a one-stop solution for material testing services. Drawing and Structural designing has been the forte of the department and continues to inspire the young minds of the region to take up Civil Engineering as profession.

                                            Electricity has become an essential requirement in our day to day life. The department has highly qualified with the specialization of Power System, Power Electronics, Control System etc. The department is headed by Mr. Rewati Raman Yadav with 5 years teaching experience along with the team of dynamic faculty members drawn electrical power beginning with domestic to industry, communication, transportation along with use of electrical power drives in textile, food processing, pharmaceutical etc makes it extremely popular among all the other branches of engineering. The basic knowledge about electricity makes him most suited for present industrial requirements as all the controls and remote operations are carried through electricity, hence this branch of engineering is more popular now a days. The privatization of electrical power sector such generation, transmission and distribution has further increased the demand for trained electrical engineers. This department is engaged to produce the competent graduate from leading institutes like IITS/NITS and other reputed universities. The faculty takes active interest in research and development activities. There is continuous internal evaluation of students through unit tests, internal assessment test and quiz programmes. The problems of students are solved to the extent possible as when they are arise. The attendance and progress reports are properly taken. The students are encouraged to participate in seminars conducted in the college.
